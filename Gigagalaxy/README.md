OVERVIEW:  
This is a series of python scripts for the analysis of the Arepo Gigagalaxy 
simulations (or equivalent zoom-in). The scripts are organized as loadable
python modules in different subfolders. An example of usage for each subcategory
is provided by *.py files of the same name. The script collection
requires the scripts in the repository Arepo-snap-util to read snapshot
and group catalogue files. 

USAGE:  
-Install the scripts of the repository Arepo-snap-util; detailed instructions
can be found in the README of that repository.  

-Run one of the example scripts provided here; for instance the script 'cgm.py' 
for circumgalactic medium plots. Paths to snapshot files and output directories 
must be changed according to the user's directory structure.

TODO:  
-Make consistent the projection scripts with the current structure organization.
