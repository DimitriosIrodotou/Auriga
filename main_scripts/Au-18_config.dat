FUNCTION Sersic
PA      90          fixed       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is rotated so the bar is along the x-axis.
ell     0.0         0,1         # 1st estimate: 0.3,0.8: the first deep in ellipticity (lower values -> profile more circular).

I_e     78                      # 1st estimate: intensity at R_eff.

FUNCTION FerrersBar2D
PA      90          fixed       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is rotated so the bar is along the x-axis.
ell     0.7         0,1         # 1st estimate: 0,1: the peak in ellipticity before the bar ends (higher values -> profile more elliptical).
c0      1.9         0,3            # 1st estimate: 0,1: it should be boxy (positive values -> profile has boxy shape).
n       0.9         0,3            # 1st estimate: (higher values -> profile truncates faster).
I_0     50                      # 1st estimate: 1/3*I_0 from the exponential fit to the isophotal ellipses.
a_bar   25          0,50            # 1st estimate: the sma value at which the second deep in the ellipticity appears.

FUNCTION Exponential
PA      179         0,180       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is face-on.
ell     0.0         0,1         # 1st estimate: minimum ellipticity from the isophotal ellipses (disc is face-on so ell should be very close to 0).
