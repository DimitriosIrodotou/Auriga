FUNCTION Sersic
PA      90          fixed       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is rotated so the bar is along the x-axis.
ell     0.02        0,1         # 1st estimate: 0.3,0.8: the first deep in ellipticity (lower values -> profile more circular).

FUNCTION FerrersBar2D
PA      90          fixed       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is rotated so the bar is along the x-axis.
ell     0.5         0,1         # 1st estimate: 0,1: the peak in ellipticity before the bar ends (higher values -> profile more elliptical).
c0      0.2         0,1         # 1st estimate: 0,1: it should be boxy (positive values -> profile has boxy shape).
n       0.5         0,2         # 1st estimate: (higher values -> profile truncates faster).
I_0     56                      # 1st estimate: 1/3*I_0 from the exponential fit to the isophotal ellipses.
a_bar   19          0,30        # 1st estimate: the sma value at which the second deep in the ellipticity appears.

FUNCTION Exponential
PA      166         0,180       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is face-on.
ell     0.0         0,1         # 1st estimate: minimum ellipticity from the isophotal ellipses (disc is face-on so ell should be very close to 0).
