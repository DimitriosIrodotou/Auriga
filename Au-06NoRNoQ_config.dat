FUNCTION FerrersBar2D
PA      90          fixed       # 1st estimate: 90: the galaxy is rotated so the bar is along the x-axis
ell     0.7         0,1         # 1st estimate: 0.3,0.8: the peak in ellipticity before the bar ends (higher values -> profile more circular).
c0      0.5         0,2         # 1st estimate: 0,1: it should be boxy (positive values -> profile has boxy shape).
n       2           0,2         # 1st estimate: (higher values -> profile truncates faster).
I_0     80          80,250      # 1st estimate: 1/3*I_0 from the exponential fit to the isophotal ellipses.
a_bar   64          30,65       # 1st estimate: the sma value at which the second deep in the ellipticity appears.

FUNCTION Exponential
PA      156
ell     0.04         0,1        # 1st estimate: minimum ellipticity from the isophotal ellipses (disc is face-on, so ell should be very close to 0).
